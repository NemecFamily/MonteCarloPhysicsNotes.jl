# 3 Simple sampling Monte Carlo methods
## Problems from Chapter 3

### Numerical Monte Carlo (MC) integration (problem 3.1 to 3.3)
In numerics Monte Carlo (MC) integration refers to a method using random
numbers. One major difference to other numerical integration methods is that the
integrand is not drawn from a regular grid. In MC the points at which the
integrand is evaluated is chosen randomly. In particular, this method unfolds
its benefits for high-dimensional integrals. For more details see
